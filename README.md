hello world repository.

Hi humans!
this is a read me file to test how GitHub works.
it looks like we managed to create a repository
and we are changing the precreated read me file. 
 



These changes will be made to just the README file on my readme-edits branch, 
so now this branch contains content thatâ€™s different from master.

edit 1:
read me file works without formatting. just like a wiki page. sentences continue after each other though in the code there are lines between them. so I need some formatting knowledge here.
